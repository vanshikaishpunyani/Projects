## Overview

Welcome to my **Projects Folder** repository! This repository contains two distinct projects that address specific goals and functionalities. Below, you'll find a brief description of each project:

### Project 1: AUTOMOBILE PRICE VALUATION

- Description: Developed a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a car based on its specifications and features.


### Project 2: CREDIT RISK ANALYSIS

- Description: The system will analyze client data and determine whether a client should be provided with a loan or not based on their creditworthiness.
The classification will help lenders and financial institutions make informed decisions about loan approvals, reducing the risk of defaults and ensuring responsible lending practices
